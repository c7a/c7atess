I have been installing the Catalyst app in /var/lib/catalyst/ocr.  

Installation:
  Some scripts need to be copied into the top catalyst directory:
    DoJob.pl
    DoImage.pl
    OCR/Ocrdb.pm
    OCR/hocrUtils.pm
    root/*
    lib/*
    inc/*
    ocr.conf

To start the web control panel, run (if you want to use port 3333)
  ./script/ocr_server.pl -p3333 --verbose --debug

Note: many CPAN modules need to be installed. When you do this, please would you note the cpanm commands
   needed and contribute this to the project?  For master and slave. And note your Linux distro.

Installation on a worker slave is by installWorker.sh.
This is pushed to a worker by pushWorker.sh



DB config:

In /etc/ocr/db.ini, normally we have 
  [DBconn]
  hostname=quark.example.org

or 
  [DBconn]
  hostname=yb.example.org

However, in the special case where the OCR database machine is also an OCR slave machine, we need:
  [DBconn]
  hostname=localmysql

Slave log dir: The installation created a directory /var/log/ocr/ in each slave computer
 which is writeable by the user running this cat app. Log rotation on this is in 
 /etc/logrotate.d/ocr (correct the user,group). With log rotation, it becomes
 easy to compare the performance of the slave computers.

/var/log/ocr/*.log {
	daily
	missingok
	rotate 52
	create 644 richard adm
}
