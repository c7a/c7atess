Installation on a worker slave is by installWorker.sh.
This is pushed to a worker by pushWorker.sh

In /etc/c7aocr/tessdb.ini, normally we have 
  [DBconn]
  hostname=quark.office.c7a.ca

or 
  [DBconn]
  hostname=yb.office.c7a.ca

However, in the special case where the OCR database machine is also an OCR slave machine, we need:
  [DBconn]
  hostname=localmysql
