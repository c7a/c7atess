Purpose:
   Run Optical Character Recognition on millions of images,
   using multiple machines and saving the results in a DB for analysis and other uses.
   
   This project is also useful for the image preprocessing, to get better results from Tesseract.

   This project is also useful for CPU intensive tasks other than OCR that can be run in parallel on machines.

Project:
   Github soon, and CPAN

To Do:
  -add your plans to this To Do list, or elaborate on it
  -the server should be launched using a service, in the scope of a ocr-data user account.

  -Installation of the master needs to be automated, beyond what is done by installWorker.sh:
   There needs to be a directory /var/run/ocr which is writeable by the user running this cat app.
  
  -pluggable OCR engine and image preprocessing
  -bundle the CPAN modules for automated installation
