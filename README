Run script/ocr_server.pl to test the application.

Installation:
  Some scripts from canadiana/trunk/ocr/ need to be copied into this top catalyst directory:
    DoJob.pl
    c7atess.pl
    CIHM/Ocrdb.pm

There needs to be a directory /var/run/c7aocr which is writeable by the user running this cat app.

Installation on a worker slave is by installWorker.sh.
This is pushed to a worker by pushWorker.sh

In /etc/c7aocr/tessdb.ini, normally we have 
  [DBconn]
  hostname=quark.office.c7a.ca

or 
  [DBconn]
  hostname=yb.office.c7a.ca

However, in the special case where the OCR database machine is also an OCR slave machine, we need:
  [DBconn]
  hostname=localmysql

Slave log dir: The installation created a directory /var/log/c7aocr/ in each slave computer which is writeable by the user running this cat app. Log rotation on this is in  /etc/logrotate.d/c7aocr (correct the user,group). With log rotation, it becomes easy to compare the performance of the slave computers.

/var/log/c7aocr/*.log {
	daily
	missingok
	rotate 52
	create 644 richard adm
}
