Run script/ocr_server.pl to test the application.

Installation:
  Some scripts from canadiana/trunk/ocr/ need to be copied into this top catalyst directory:
    c7aocr.pl
    c7atess.pl
    Ocrdb.pm

There needs to be a directory /var/run/c7aocr which is writeable by the user running this cat app.

There needs to be a directory /var/log/c7aocr/ in each slave computer which is writeable by the user running this cat app. I recommend log rotation on this in  /etc/logrotate.d/c7aocr (correct the user,group). With log rotation, it becomes easy to compare the performance of the slave computers.

/var/log/c7aocr/*.log {
	daily
	missingok
	rotate 52
	create 644 richard adm
}
